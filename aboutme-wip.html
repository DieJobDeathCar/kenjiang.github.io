                        <h3 id="location">Winston-Salen, NC</h3>
                        <p>At the beginnig of 2020, I was presented with the opportunity to take on a role in a another business unit within the company. 
                            The role operates in the Marketing domain with a heavy focus on product management. Being the adventurous type of person I am,
                            I accepted the role and moved to North Carolina. Next thing you know, I am the new Product Portfolio Manager for our eCommerce Channel team.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            2020 was an unusual year. The COVID-19 pandemic took over the world by surprise and I was forced to adopt a completely virtual lifestyle not long after the outbreak.
                            It felt surreal to me at the time that I was able to join conference calls wearing t-shirts and slippers. It's not that I didn't take things seriously, but because it has become the new norm for everyone as well.
                            Having had more operational experiences in the online spaces, our team was the first to fully adapt to the changes and turned them into our advantages; We were able to capture large amounts of
                            market shares from the influx of ecommerce demands and had grew our product lines expotentially. By the end of the year, *insert accurate achievement*
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            During my time at Liberty Hardware, I began to miss my home and my family. The pandemic has made me realized that none of these successes would matter without them. At the end of 2020, I left the company to be reunited with my family.

                        <h3 id="location">Ann Arbor, MI</h3>
                        <p>After graduation, I joined Masco Corporation, one of the largest home improvement product manufacturers
                            in the world. It was clear to me at the time that I'm ready to step foot into the corporate world and begin a new chapter in my book.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I started my role as a Supply Chain Analyst joining the Direct Material Purchasing team's and providing supports to daily operations and projects.
                            We were responsible for keeping the business unit's manufacturing up and running smoothly with abundant raw materials while continuously 
                            exploring cost-saving opportunities. The team worked diligently and with a sense of purpose to satisfy both internal and external customers.
                            We generated over $10M in cost-savings and expanded our sourcing operations to multiple global locations like Thailand and Vietnam.
                            <br>
                            <br> 
                            I wouldn‚Äôt trade my tenure at Masco Cabinetry for anything. I was incredibly fortunate to meet some of the brightest minds in the industry
                            and made many lifelong friends along the journey.
