# Update Logs

## 7/17/22
- React app version of the page is LIVE (link is at the top of the page)! Hosted on firebase because, well, I want to step out of my Github comfort zone. 
- HOWEVER, the Contacts page is not done yet. But that wouldn't be too difficult to do as I have found a way to have a single codebase to deploy on both GH and Firebase platforms. All part of the learning process.

## 7/16/22
- In parallel to development of Contacts page, I've decided it's time to step up the game and re-engineer it with React JS. Why? Because it offers flexibility and unlocks access to dynamic features.
- ### MORE IMPORTANTLY, It's also a great learning opportunity so why not :)
