Building my first personal webpage from scratch!

Webpages hosted by Github Page SSG. Will explore dynamic hosting as I progress.

I've decided to use the single linked style.css for all my html pages.

Stylings are separated by classes and elements uniqued named for each pages, with custom variables.
