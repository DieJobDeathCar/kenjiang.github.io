Building my first personal webpage from scratch!

Webpages hosted by Github Page SSG. Will explore dynamic hosting as I progress.

I've decided to use the single linked style.css for all my html pages.

Stylings are separated by classes and elements uniqued named for each pages, with custom variables.



# Design

- In parallel to development of Contacts page, I've decided it's time to step up the game and integrate this project into the Gatsby framework. Why?
- 1. because the framework was built and optimized for static websites
- 2. because it allows better integration with React library in JavaScript
- 3. because it gives great flexibility to incorporate new webpage functionality
- ### MORE IMPORTANTLY, It's also a great learning opportunity so why not :)
- This'll likely take longer time to do due to conversion of syntax and styling tweaks, just FYI.
